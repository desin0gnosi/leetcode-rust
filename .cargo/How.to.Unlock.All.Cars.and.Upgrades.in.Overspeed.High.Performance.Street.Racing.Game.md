Overspeed High Performance Street Racing is not a game that will impress you with its graphics or sound. The cars look dated and the environments are bland and repetitive. The sound effects are generic and the music is annoying. The game also suffers from some technical issues, such as bugs, crashes and poor optimization. You will need a powerful PC to run this game smoothly, even though it does not look like it.
 
However, if you are looking for a challenging and realistic racing game, you might find some enjoyment in Overspeed High Performance Street Racing. The game offers a variety of modes, such as career, time trial and quick race. You can also customize your car with different parts and livery, although the options are limited and not very noticeable. The game's strongest point is its physics and handling, which are very realistic and demanding. You will need to master the controls and learn the tracks to win races. You will also need to avoid crashing into walls or other cars, as the damage system is unforgiving and can affect your performance.
 
Overspeed High Performance Street Racing is a game that tries to emulate the success of Need for Speed Underground, but fails to deliver on many aspects. It is a cheap and mediocre racing game that only hardcore fans of the genre might appreciate. It is not a game that will appeal to casual or mainstream gamers, who will find it boring and frustrating. If you are looking for a better racing game, you should look elsewhere.
  
If you want to improve your skills and performance in Overspeed High Performance Street Racing, you might want to follow some tips and tricks that can help you win more races and avoid frustration. Here are some of them:

- Choose your car wisely. Different cars have different strengths and weaknesses, such as speed, acceleration, handling and durability. You should pick a car that suits your driving style and the track you are racing on. For example, if you are racing on a twisty track, you might want a car with good handling and braking. If you are racing on a straight track, you might want a car with high speed and acceleration.
- Upgrade your car smartly. You can upgrade your car with various parts and livery that can improve its performance and appearance. However, you should not waste your money and parts on upgrades that do not make a significant difference. You should focus on the upgrades that matter the most, such as the engine, the tires, the suspension and the nitrous oxide system. You should also balance your upgrades so that your car does not become too heavy or unstable.
- Use the nitrous oxide system wisely. The nitrous oxide system can give you a boost of speed when you need it, but it also consumes fuel and can overheat your engine. You should use it sparingly and strategically, such as when you are overtaking an opponent, escaping a crash or reaching the finish line. You should also avoid using it when you are turning or braking, as it can make you lose control of your car.
- Learn the tracks and shortcuts. You should familiarize yourself with the tracks and their layouts, such as the turns, the bumps, the obstacles and the shortcuts. You should know when to slow down, when to speed up, when to drift and when to cut corners. You should also look for shortcuts that can save you time and distance, such as alleys, ramps or tunnels. However, you should also be careful of the risks involved in taking shortcuts, such as traffic, police or traps.

Overspeed High Performance Street Racing is a game that requires skill and patience to master. It is not a game for everyone, but if you are a fan of realistic and challenging racing games, you might find it enjoyable and rewarding. With these tips and tricks, you can improve your chances of winning races and unlocking more cars and upgrades.
