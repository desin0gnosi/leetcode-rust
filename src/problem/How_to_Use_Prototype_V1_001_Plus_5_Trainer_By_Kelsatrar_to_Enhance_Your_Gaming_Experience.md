If you are looking for some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay in Prototype, here are some suggestions that might help you:

- Start with a clear vision of what you want to achieve with your prototype. What are the main features, mechanics, and goals of your game? What are the unknowns that you need to test and validate? Having a clear vision will help you focus on the most important aspects of your prototype and avoid wasting time on unnecessary details.
- Don't paper prototype. Paper prototyping is a useful technique for some types of games, but not for Prototype. Prototype is a game that relies heavily on physics, animation, and visual feedback. Paper prototyping will not capture these elements well and will not give you a realistic sense of how your game feels and plays. Instead, use a digital tool that allows you to quickly create and iterate on your prototype.
- Be FBR: Fast, Bad, and Right. This means that you should aim to create your prototype as fast as possible, without worrying too much about the quality or polish. The goal is to test your core idea and see if it works, not to create a finished product. However, you should also make sure that your prototype is right, meaning that it accurately represents your vision and answers your questions. A fast and bad prototype that is wrong will not give you any useful feedback.
- Make it look bad. This may sound counterintuitive, but making your prototype look bad can actually be beneficial. It can help you avoid getting attached to your prototype or falling into the trap of over-designing it. It can also help you communicate to others that your prototype is not a final product and that you are open to feedback and changes. You can make your prototype look bad by using simple shapes, colors, and textures, or by adding some visual cues that indicate that it is a work in progress.
- Build only what you need. Don't get distracted by adding features or content that are not essential for testing your core idea. Remember that your prototype is not a game, but a tool for learning and validation. You should only build what you need to test your assumptions and hypotheses, and nothing more. If something is not directly related to your vision or your questions, leave it out.
- Build a template project. A template project is a basic framework that contains all the common elements and functionalities that you need for your prototype. For example, a template project for Prototype could include the movement system, the combat system, the shapeshifting system, and the UI elements. Having a template project can save you a lot of time and effort when creating new prototypes, as you don't have to start from scratch every time. You can simply modify or add what you need for each specific prototype.
- Be like Autopilot. Autopilot is a feature in Prototype that allows Alex to automatically run towards his target or destination without any input from the player. You can use this feature to test your prototype more efficiently and effectively. For example, you can use Autopilot to see how Alex interacts with different environments, enemies, or objects without having to control him manually. You can also use Autopilot to see how other players or testers react to your prototype without influencing them with your own actions.

By following these tips and tricks, you can create better prototypes for Prototype and get more valuable feedback from them. Remember that prototyping is an iterative process that requires constant testing and improvement. Don't be afraid to experiment, fail, learn, and try again until you find the best solution for your game.
