## Installing and activating the plugin
 
To install SIGERTOOLS VRay Studio Setup Pro, you need to download the installer from the official website[^1^] or from your email if you have purchased a license. Then, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to specify the path to your 3ds Max installation folder and choose the version of V-Ray that you are using.
 
To activate the plugin, you need to launch 3ds Max and go to Customize > Customize User Interface. In the Toolbars tab, select SIGERSHOP in the Category list and drag the VRayStudioSetup icon to any toolbar. Then, click on the icon to open the plugin interface. You will see a dialog box asking you to enter your license key. Copy and paste your license key from your email and click OK. You should see a message confirming that your license is activated.
 
## Creating a studio environment
 
To create a studio environment, you need to open the plugin interface by clicking on the VRayStudioSetup icon on the toolbar. You will see a panel with several tabs: Environment, Lights, Presets, Render Settings, and About. In the Environment tab, you can choose from different types of backgrounds: solid color, gradient, cyclorama, or HDRI. For this example, we will use a cyclorama background, which is a curved wall that creates a seamless transition between the floor and the wall.
 
To create a cyclorama background, click on the Create button next to Cyclorama. You will see a dialog box where you can adjust the size and color of the cyclorama. For this example, we will use the default values. Click OK to create the cyclorama. You should see a large white curved wall in your viewport.
 
## Adding and adjusting light sources
 
To add light sources, you need to go to the Lights tab in the plugin interface. You will see a list of different types of light sources: Softbox (Rectangular), Softbox (Circular), Spotlight (Rectangular), Spotlight (Circular), Reflector (Rectangular), Reflector (Circular), Dome Light (HDRI), Sun Light (V-Ray Sun), Sky Light (V-Ray Sky), IES Light (V-Ray IES). For this example, we will use two softboxes and two reflectors.
 
To add a softbox, click on the Create button next to Softbox (Rectangular). You will see a dialog box where you can adjust the size, color, intensity, position, rotation, and shape of the softbox. For this example, we will use a large softbox with a warm color and a high intensity as our key light. We will position it above and slightly behind our car model. Click OK to create the softbox. You should see a rectangular light source in your viewport.
 
To add another softbox, repeat the same process but use a smaller softbox with a cool color and a lower intensity as our fill light. We will position it below and slightly in front of our car model.
 
To add a reflector, click on the Create button next to Reflector (Rectangular). You will see a dialog box where you can adjust the size, color, position, rotation, and shape of the reflect
